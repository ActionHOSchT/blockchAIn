# Blockchain
## Introduction
This course is targeted towards computer science students of the [University of Applied Sciences in Fulda](https://www.hs-fulda.de/), but you can still follow along if you are familiar with Java.
There will be some accompanying videos in German. Do not despair: the important parts will be covered in this README or with alternative resources.

You might have learned the basics of Java in the module _Programming 1_ but are not sure how to apply them in a full-blown project.
Well, that's where _Programming 2_ comes in handy, but until then let's build a blockchain.
Needless to say that this will be a prototype and not the bullet-proof foundation of the next hot crypto-currency.
However, we will learn a thing or two about real-world blockchains along the way.
